### Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster
This is my attempt at creating a classifier from a dataset of Titanic passengers. The dataset is from a [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com) competition. I've used python and the sklearn library. 

#### Files
* train.csv - training data with labels
* test.csv - testing data without labels
* titanic_classifier.py - main Python file, to run, type ```python titanic.py```
* rfpredictions.csv - Predictions on the test data
